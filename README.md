# That's the Spirit!

> What's it do?

Thats the Spirit is a Punny Web application that allows users to find and learn how to make new Cocktails. 
There is a search function with as well as a library with the cocktail name and image because we all eat with our eyes first! If a user likes a cocktail, they can rate and/or favorite the cocktail. A user is also given reccomendations based on their favorite drinks and can even send other users reccomendations!
